## What is this ?

I am copying Tsoding's idea([https://github.com/tsoding/aoc-2020](https://github.com/tsoding/aoc-2020)), where he solved each problem in a different language.

You can find my implementations in the `solutions` directory.

## Setup

The `Dockerfile` included in the project contains an ubuntu container with all necessary tools to compile and execute all solutions.

To use, just build the image using `docker build -t aoc-2021 .`

And to run, you can use the `run.sh` script. 

## Languages Plan:

- [x] Day 01 - Rust
- [x] Day 02 - Haskell
- [x] Day 03 - JAVA
- [x] Day 04 - D
- [ ] Day 05 - Go (Solved it in `C++` previously, which was basically `C` code compiled by `g++`, but I don't want to repeat `C` twice, so will solve this in `GoLang` someday. I am too lazy to parse that input.)
- [x] Day 06 - Elixir
- [x] Day 07 - Python
- [x] Day 08 - Javascript
- [x] Day 09 - Stardard ML(smlnj)
- [x] Day 10 - C
- [x] Day 11 - Nim
- [x] Day 12 - Perl
- [x] Day 13 - C#
- [x] Day 14 - PHP
- [ ] Day 15 - Pascal
- [x] Day 16 - Ruby
- [ ] Day 17 - Scala
- [ ] Day 18 - Kotlin
- [ ] Day 19 - Lua
- [ ] Day 20 - `undefined`
- [ ] Day 21 - Racket
- [ ] Day 22 - Groovy
- [ ] Day 23 - Dart
- [ ] Day 24 - Ada
- [ ] Day 25 - `undefined`

This is just a tentitive list, and may change when I actually try to solve the problem in that programming language. 

Since I don't know most of the programming languages in this list, so it mostly depandent on, if I will be able to learn the language enough or not, to solve the problem.

Some candidate languages for the `undefined` slots: 
*Swift, Erlang, Clojure*

Suggest more options, if you know any interesting languages :)
